# Batch Renamer  
Renames batch of items in Finder (files, folders, anything that can be renamed).

## How to use

### 1.  Select items in the Finder.  
        (
		Remember:  Items appear in the renaming queue in the order they are selected.
              So for example, the items you want to rename appear in a Finder window in this order:
	 		-  image.jpg
			-  essay.doc
			-  folder1
		
              But you want to rename them (with numbers at the beginning) in this order:
			-  01 folder1
			-  02 image.jpg
			-  03 essay.doc
		
	      So you must select the items in that order, then run the app.
	)
	

### 2.  Run the app.
