# BatchRenamer  
Renames batch of items in Mac Finder (anything that can be renamed).  
This script can be saved as an application, or be run as is.

## How to use

### 1.  Select items in the Finder.

### 2.  Run the app.


Remember:  Items appear in the renaming queue in the order they are selected in Finder.  
For example, the items you want to rename appear in a window in this order:
-  image.jpg
-  essay.doc
-  folder1

But you want to rename them (with numbers at the beginning) in this order:
-  01 folder1
-  02 image.jpg
-  03 essay.doc

So you must select the items in that order (folder1, image.jpg, essay.doc) before you run  
the app.


## Useful Tips

### If items you want to rename are in different folders from one another:
-  Create a Finder tag to assign to those items.  
-  Put that tag in window sidebar so all those items appear in the window.  
-  Select items and run BatchRenamer.
